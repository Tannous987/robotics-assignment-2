This repository contains the following:
  master: Initially, all tasks were done manually in this branch.
  automated-creation: This branch included an additional folder called automatically-created-assignment, with a setup.sh script that automates the manual tasks.
  
The two branches have now been merged, and the current branch includes both the manual work and the automation script.
